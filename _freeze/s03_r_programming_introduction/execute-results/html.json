Huge thanks to [Julie Lowndes](https://jules32.github.io/) for writing most of this content and letting us build on her material, which in turn was built on [Jenny Bryan's](https://jennybryan.org/about/) materials. We highly recommend reading through the original lessons and using them as reference (see in the resources section below).\n:::\n\n## Welcome to R Programming\n\n![Artwork by Allison Horst](images/r_programming_introduction/allison-horst-code-kitchen.png)\n\nThere is a vibrant community out there that is collectively developing increasingly easy to use and powerful open source programming tools. The changing landscape of programming is making learning how to code easier than it ever has been. Incorporating programming into analysis workflows not only makes science more efficient, but also more computationally reproducible. In this course, we will use the programming language R, and the accompanying integrated development environment (IDE) RStudio. R is a great language to learn for data-oriented programming because it is widely adopted, user-friendly, and (most importantly) open source.\n\nSo what is the difference between R and RStudio? Here is an analogy to start us off. Imagine you are a chef, and you have to prepare a meal.  You'll need a place to work (a kitchen), you'll need some tools (pots, pans, a knife, etc), and you'll need some ingredients.  In this analogy, **R is a good chef's knife** - one of the most important tools that you'll use to accomplish your task.\n\nAnd **if R is your chef's knife, RStudio is your kitchen**. RStudio provides a place to do your work! RStudio makes your life as a researcher easier by bringing together other tools you need to do your work efficiently - like a file browser, data viewer, help pages, terminal, community, support, the list goes on. So it's not just the infrastructure (the user interface or IDE), although it is a great way to learn and interact with your variables, files, and interact directly with git. It's also data science philosophy, R packages, community, and more. \n\n(and in this analogy, your ingredients are **data**!)\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n### R without RStudio?\n\nJust as you can prepare food without a kitchen, we could learn R without RStudio, but that's not what we're going to do.  RStudio makes it much easier to work with R, just as a well stocked kitchen makes cooking more fun.  We are going to take advantage of the great RStudio support, and learn R and RStudio together.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\n### New to coding? new to R? No worries!\n\nSomething else to start us off is to mention that you are learning a new language here. It's an ongoing process, it takes time, you'll make mistakes, it can be frustrating, but it will be overwhelmingly awesome in the long run. We all speak at least one language; it's a similar process, really. And no matter how fluent you are, you'll always be learning, you'll be trying things in new contexts, learning words that mean the same as others, etc, just like everybody else. And just like any form of communication, there will be miscommunication that can be frustrating, but hands down we are all better off because of it.\n\nWhile language is a familiar concept, programming languages are in a different context from spoken languages and you will understand this context with time. For example: you have a concept that there is a first meal of the day, and there is a name for that: in English it's \"breakfast.\" So if you're learning Spanish, you could expect there is a word for this concept of a first meal. (And you'd be right: \"desayuno\"). We will get you to expect that programming languages also have words (called functions) for concepts as well. You'll soon expect that there is a way to order values numerically. Or alphabetically. Or search for patterns in text. Or calculate the median. Or reorganize columns to rows. Or subset exactly what you want. We will get you to increase your expectations and learn to ask and find what you're looking for.\n:::\n\n## Using R within the RStudio IDE\n\nLet's take a tour of the RStudio interface.\n\n[Full Screen](slides/r_programming_introduction/slides1_coding_in_console.html)\n\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck\" src=\"slides/r_programming_introduction/slides1_coding_in_console.html\" style=\"border: 1px solid #2e3846;\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n### Objects in R\n\nLet's say the value of 12 that we got from running `3 * 4` is a really important value we need to keep. To keep information in R, we need to create an **object**. The way information is stored in R is through objects.\n\nWe can assign a value of a mathematical operation (and more!) to an object in R using the assignment operator, `<-` (greater than sign and minus sign). All objects in R are created using the assignment operator, following this form: `object_name <- value`.\n\n::: {.callout-exercise}\n\n**Create an object!**\n\nAssign your favorite number to an object called `fave_num`.  Then, create an object called `fave_squared` and assign the square of `fave_num` (use the superscript, like `5^2`), and inspect the object.\n\n:::: {.callout-answer}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### think of this code as someone saying \"fave_num gets 42\".\nfave_num <- 42\n\n### and then square it\nfave_squared <- fave_num^2\nfave_squared\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1764\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNotice how after creating the `fave_num` object, R doesn't print anything. However, we know our code worked because we see the object, and the value we wanted to store is now visible in our **Global Environment**. We can force R to print the value of the object by calling the object name (aka typing it out) or by using parentheses.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### printing the object by calling the object name\nfave_squared\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1764\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### printing the object by wrapping the assignment syntax in parentheses\n(fave_squared <- fave_num^2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1764\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::::\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n#### Autocomplete\n\nWhen you begin typing an object name RStudio will automatically show suggested completions for you that you can select by hitting `tab`, then press `return`.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n#### Up/down arrow to recall previous commands\n\nWhen you're in the Console use the up and down arrow keys to call your command history, with the most recent commands being shown first.\n:::\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\nBefore we run more calculations, let's talk about naming objects. For the object `fave_num` we used an underscore to separate the object name. This naming convention is called **snake case**. There are other naming conventions including, but not limited to:\n\n-   `we_used_snake_case`\n-   `someUseCamelCase`\n-   `SomeUseUpperCamelCaseAlsoCalledPascalCase`\n\nChoosing a [naming convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)#:~:text=In%20computer%20programming%2C%20a%20naming,in%20source%20code%20and%20documentation) is a personal preference, but once you choose one, or your collaborative team chooses one - be consistent! A consistent naming convention will increase the readability of your code for others and your future self.\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n#### Rules for object names\n\nObject names cannot start with a numeric digit and cannot contain certain characters such as commas, spaces, or hyphens.\n:::\n\n## Running code in an R Script\n\nSo far we've been running code in the Console, let's try running code in an R Script. An R Script is a simple text file. RStudio uses an R Script by copying R commands from text in the file and pastes them into the Console as if you were manually entering commands yourself.\n\n[Full Screen](slides/r_programming_introduction/slides2_coding_in_script.html)\n\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck\" src=\"slides/r_programming_introduction/slides2_coding_in_script.html\" style=\"border: 1px solid #2e3846;\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-exercise}\n\n**Create a vector!**\n\nCreate a vector containing the values 18.1, 8.9, 11.3, 11.2, and 15.7.  These are heights of several trees in a park, in meters. Save the vector as an object with an appropriate name.  Then, convert the heights from meters to feet, and store the result in a new object with an appropriate name.\n\nBonus: find the average height of trees in the park (hint: look at the `mean()` function: `?mean` will show you the help page)\n\n:::: {.callout-answer}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### Height of trees in meters\ntree_h_m <- c(18.1, 8.9, 11.3, 11.2, 15.7)\n\nm_to_ft <- 3.28  ### meters to feet conversion ratio\n\n### Height of trees in feet\ntree_h_ft <- tree_h_m * m_to_ft\n\n### Mean height of trees, in feet\nmean(tree_h_ft)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 42.7712\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::::\n\n:::\n\n## Data types and structures in R\n\nWe've been using primarily `integer` or `numeric` data types so far. Let's create an object that has a string value or a `character` data type, i.e., text instead of numbers.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nscience_rocks <- \"yes it does!\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n`\"yes it does!\"` is a string, and R knows it's text and not a number because it is surrounded by quotes `\" \"`.\n\n:::{.callout-exercise}\nTry running the following lines in your script or console:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n\"Hello world!\" * 5\n\n\"7\" * 5\n\n7 * 5\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened? What do you see in the Console? How do the three lines differ?  (If in your script, either delete the non-functioning lines, or comment them out).\n:::\n\n**This lead us to an important concept in programming:** There are different \"classes\" or types of objects in R (or any other programming language). The operations you can do with an object will depend on what type of object it is because each object has their own specialized format, designed for a specific purpose. While `7 * 5` seems like a reasonable calculation, `\"banana\" * \"apple\"` doesn't make much sense.  But there are many cool things we can do with strings that we can't do with numbers. \n\n:::{.callout-tip}\nYou can work with strings in your data in R easily thanks to the [`stringr`](http://stringr.tidyverse.org/) and [`tidytext`](https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext) packages.\n:::\n\n[Full Screen](slides/r_programming_introduction/slides3_data_structures.html)\n\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck\" src=\"slides/r_programming_introduction/slides3_data_structures.html\" style=\"border: 1px solid #2e3846;\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-exercise}\n\n## Accessing data in a data frame\n\nWorking with data frames is an important skill for data science in R.  There are some built-in datasets in R, including sample data frames that we can work with.  Let's access the built-in `mtcars` data frame, a set of attributes of various cars from Motor Trends 1974.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(mtcars) ### loads a built-in dataset\nhead(mtcars) ### look at the first few rows\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                   mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\nMazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\nDatsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\nHornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nHornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\nValiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nFigure out at least 3 ways to access the horsepower `hp` of a Datsun 710.\n\n:::: {.callout-answer}\n\nHere are a few ways that would work:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#|eval: false\n### choose the 3rd row, 4th column:\nmtcars[3, 4]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 93\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### Put the hp column into a vector, then choose\n### the 3rd element of the vector (3 ways):\nx <- mtcars$hp\nx[3]           \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 93\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny <- mtcars[['hp']]\ny[3]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 93\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nz <- mtcars[ , 4]\nz[3]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 93\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### note, you can chain these:\nmtcars$hp[3]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 93\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### Similarly, select just the Datsun 710 row (3),\n### then choose the hp out of that\nx <- mtcars[3, ]\nx$hp\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 93\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### Use row names and column names:\nmtcars['Datsun 710', 'hp']\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 93\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe'll learn more ways later, with the powerful and popular `tidyverse` package.  Note that choosing by row number and column number is a little risky - what if someone reorders the rows or columns and doesn't tell you?  So choosing by name where possible, or filtering using logical tests, is generally preferable!\n::::\n\n:::\n\n## R Functions\n\nSo far we've learned some of the basic syntax and concepts of R programming, and how to navigate RStudio, but we haven't done any complicated or interesting programming processes yet. This is where functions come in!  In R, an **object** is a **noun** while a **function** is a **verb** - functions do all our data science work for us.\n\n[Full Screen](slides/r_programming_introduction/slides4_functions.html)\n\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck\" src=\"slides/r_programming_introduction/slides4_functions.html\" style=\"border: 1px solid #2e3846;\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n### Examples\n\nLet's create a vector to store the noon temperature (in Celsius) in Santa Barbara for three consecutive summer days:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntemp_c <- c(25, 29, 31)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-exercise}\n\n**Use the `mean()` function to calculate the mean temperature**\n\nFrom the its Help page, we learned this function will take the mean of a set of numbers. Very convenient! \n\nWe also learned that `mean()` only has one argument we need to supply a value to (`x`). The rest of the arguments have default values that we can override if we like.\n\n::: {.callout-answer}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(x = temp_c)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 28.33333\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-exercise}\n\n**Save the mean to an object called `mean_temp_c`**\n\n:::: {.callout-hint}\nWhat operator do we use to save values to an object?\n::::\n\n:::: {.callout-answer}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### saving the mean using the assignment operator `<-`\nmean_temp_c <- mean(x = temp_c)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::::\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-exercise}\n\nEarlier we created a vector containing the heights of several trees, in meters: `tree_h_m`.  Find the mean tree height and store it in a new object called `mean_h_m`:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean_height_m <- mean(tree_h_m)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nTen years later, the trees have all grown 3 meters taller.  Update your vector:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_h_m <- tree_h_m + 3 ### note, this adds 3 to each element!\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNow, call `mean_height_m` in the console or take a look at your Global Environment. Is that the value you expected? Why or why not?\n\n:::: {.callout-answer}\n\nPerhaps you expected `mean_height_m` to change when you changed `tree_h_m`?  It did not!  This demonstrates an important R programming concept: **Assigning a value to one object does not change the values of other objects in R.**  Until you recalculate the mean height, `mean_height_m` still has its original value.\n\n::::\n\n:::\n\nNow that we understand why the object's value hasn't changed - how do we update the value of `mean_height_m`? How is an R Script useful for this?\n\nThis lead us to another important programming concept, specifically for R Scripts: **An R Script runs top to bottom.**\n\nThis order of operations is important because if you are running code line by line, the values in object may be unexpected. When you are done writing your code in an R Script, it's good practice to clear your Global Environment and use the `Run` button and select \"Run all\" to test that your R Script successfully runs top to bottom.\n\n### Use the `read.csv()` function to read a file into R\n\nSo far we have learned how to assign values to objects in R, and what a function is, but we haven't quite put it all together yet with real data yet. To do this, we will introduce the function `read.csv()`, which will be in the first lines of many of your future scripts. It does exactly what it says, it reads in a csv file to R.\n\nSince this is our first time using this function, first access the help page for `read.csv()`. This has a lot of information in it, as this function has a lot of arguments, and the first one is especially important - we have to tell it what file to look for. Let's get a file!\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### Download a file from the Arctic Data Center\n\n1)  Navigate to this dataset by Craig Tweedie that is published on the Arctic Data Center. [Craig Tweedie. 2009. North Pole Environmental Observatory Bottle Chemistry. Arctic Data Center. doi:10.18739/A25T3FZ8X.](http://doi.org/10.18739/A25T3FZ8X)\n2)  Download the csv file called `BGchem2008data.csv` by clicking the \"download\" button next to the file (cloud with down arrow).\n    * If on your own computer, save it in a folder called `data` in the same place as your script.\n    * If on an NCEAS server, after downloading the file to your own computer, click the \"Upload\" button in your RStudio server file browser.  In the dialog box, make sure the destination directory is the `data` directory in your R project, click \"Choose File,\" and locate the `BGchem2008data.csv` file. Press \"OK\" to upload the file.\n3) Check your file was successfully uploaded by navigating into your `data` folder in the **Files** pane.\n\n:::\n\n\nNow we have to tell `read.csv()` how to find the file. We do this using the `file` argument which you can see in the usage section in the help page. In R, you can either use absolute paths (which will start with your home directory `~/`) or paths **relative to your current working directory.** RStudio has some great auto-complete capabilities when using relative paths, so we will go that route. \n\nAssuming you have moved your file to a folder within `training_{USERNAME}` called `data`, and your working directory is your project directory (`training_{USERNAME}`) your `read.csv()` call will look like this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# reading in data using relative paths\nbg_chem_dat <- read.csv(file = \"data/BGchem2008data.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nYou should now have an object of the class `data.frame` in your environment called `bg_chem_dat`. Check your environment pane to ensure this is true. Or you can check the class using the function `class()` in the console.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\n#### Optional Arguments\nNotice that in the Help page there are many arguments that we didn't use in the call above. Some of the arguments in function calls are optional, and some are required. \n\nOptional arguments will be shown in the usage section with a `name = value` pair, with the default value shown. If you do not specify a `name = value` pair for that argument in your function call, the function will assume the default value (example: `header = TRUE` for `read.csv()`). \n\nRequired arguments will only show the name of the argument, without a value. Note that the only *required* argument for `read.csv()` is `file`.\n\n::::\n\nYou can always specify arguments in `name = value` form. But if you do not, R attempts to resolve by position. So above, it is assumed that we want `file = \"data/BGchem2008data.csv\"`, since file is the first argument. \n\nIf we explicitly called the `file` argument our code would like this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbg_chem_dat <- read.csv(file = \"data/BGchem2008data.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIf we wanted to add another argument, say `stringsAsFactors`, we need to specify it explicitly using the `name = value` pair, since the second argument is `header`. \n\nMany R users (including myself) will set the `stringsAsFactors` argument using the following call:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# relative file path\nbg_chem_dat <- read.csv(\"data/BGchem2008data.csv\", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\n#### Quick Tip\n\nFor functions that are used often, you'll see many programmers will write code that does not explicitly call the first or second argument of a function.  For unfamiliar or uncommon functions, it's a good idea to explicitly call the names of each argument - so your collaborators (including future-you!) can quickly understand the code.\n\n:::\n\n### Working with data frames in R\n\nRemember, a `data.frame` is a data structure in R that can represent tables and spreadsheets. It is a collection of rows and columns of data, where each column has a name and represents a variable, and each row represents an observation containing a measurement of that variable.  When we ran `read.csv()`, we read the file data into a `data.frame` and then saved the result in the object `bg_chem_dat`.  Explore the dataset:\n\n-   Click on the word `bg_chem_dat` in the environment pane\n-   Click on the arrow next to `bg_chem_dat` in the environment pane\n-   Execute `head(bg_chem_dat)` in the Console\n-   Execute `View(bg_chem_dat)` in the Console\n\nLet's examine specific columns and run some basic calculations, using R functions.  Try these, try out other functions and calculations.  Can you calculate the standard deviation or sum?  Don't worry, if you try something and don't get it right, nothing bad will happen - at worst, you get an error message and try again.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(bg_chem_dat$Date)\n\nmean_temp <- mean(bg_chem_dat$CTD_Temperature)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### Other ways to load tablular data\n\nWhile the base R package provides `read.csv` as a common way to load tabular data from text files, there are many other ways that can be convenient and will also produce a `data.frame` as output. Here are a few:\n\n1. Use the `readr::read_csv()` function from the Tidyverse to load the data file. The `readr` package has a bunch of convenient helpers and handles CSV files in typically expected ways, like properly typing dates and time columns. `bg_chem_dat <- readr::read_csv(\"data/BGchem2008data.csv\")`\n2. Load tabular data from Excel spreadsheets using the `readxl::read_excel()` function.\n3.

Let's ask some \"questions\" about the `tree_h_m` object we made.\n\n-   `==` means 'is equal to'\n-   `!=` means 'is not equal to'\n-   `<` means 'is less than'\n-   `>` means 'is greater than'\n-   `<=` means 'is less than or equal to'\n-   `>=` means 'is greater than or equal to'\n\nR will apply the logical test to each element of a vector and tell you the result as TRUE or FALSE.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# examples using logical operators and expressions\ntree_h_m == 8.9\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_h_m >= 14\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_h_m != 11.3\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Error messages are your friends\n\n::: {.columns}\n\n:::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n![](images/r_programming_introduction/practicalDev_googleErrorMessage.jpg){width=\"100%\"}\n\n\n::::\n::::{.column width=\"50%\"}\nThere is an implicit contract with the computer/scripting language: Computer will do tedious computation for you. In return, you the user will be completely precise in your instructions. Typos matter. Case matters. Pay attention to how you type.\n\nRemember that this is a language, not dissimilar to English! There are times you aren't understood -- it's going to happen. There are different ways this can happen. Sometimes you'll get an error. This is like someone saying 'What?' or 'Pardon'? Error messages can also be more useful, like when they say 'I didn't understand this specific part of what you said, I was expecting something else'. That is a great type of error message.  Other times they are inscrutable.  Those are not great.\n\n::::\n\n:::\n\nError messages are a learning opportunity.  Use Google or ChatGPT (copy-and-paste!) to figure out what they mean. Note that knowing how to Google is a skill and takes practice - use our [Masters of Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) (MEDS) program workshop [Teach Me How to Google](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/teach-me-how-to-google/#1) as a guide.\n\nAnd also know that there are errors that can creep in more subtly, without an error message right away, when you are giving information that is understood, but not in the way you meant. Like if I'm telling a story about tables and you're picturing where you eat breakfast and I'm talking about data. This can leave me thinking I've gotten something across that the listener (or R) interpreted very differently. And as I continue telling my story you get more and more confused... So write clean code and check your work as you go to minimize these circumstances!\n\n## R Packages\n\n![Artwork by Allison Horst](images/r_programming_introduction/allison-horst-r-doorway.png){width=\"80%\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nR packages are the building blocks of computational reproducibility in R. Each package contains a set of related functions that enable you to more easily do a task or set of tasks in R. There are thousands of community-maintained packages out there for just about every imaginable use of R - including many that you have probably never thought of!\n\nTo install a package, we use the syntax `install.packages(\"packge_name\")`. A package only needs to be installed once, so this code can be run directly in the console if needed. Generally, you don't want to save your install package calls in a script, because when you run the script it will re-install the package, which you only need to do once, or if you need to update the package.\n\n## R Resources\n\n+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Learning R Resources | -

The Workspace is where user-defined objects accumulate. There are a few useful commands for getting information about your Environment, which make it easier for you to reference your objects when your Environment gets filled with many, many objects.\n\n![](images/r_programming_introduction/RStudio_IDE_env.png)\n\nYou can get a listing of these objects with a couple of different R functions:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobjects()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] \"fave_num\"      \"fave_squared\"  \"m_to_ft\"       \"mean_height_m\"\n [5] \"mean_temp_c\"   \"mtcars\"        \"science_rocks\" \"temp_c\"       \n [9] \"tree_h_ft\"     \"tree_h_m\"      \"x\"             \"y\"            \n[13] \"z\"            \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nls()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] \"fave_num\"      \"fave_squared\"  \"m_to_ft\"       \"mean_height_m\"\n [5] \"mean_temp_c\"   \"mtcars\"        \"science_rocks\" \"temp_c\"       \n [9] \"tree_h_ft\"     \"tree_h_m\"      \"x\"             \"y\"            \n[13] \"z\"            \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to remove the object named `tree_h_m`, you can do this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrm(tree_h_m)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nTo remove everything (or click the Broom icon in the Environment pane):\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrm(list = ls())\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {,callout-tip}\n#### Quick Tip\n\nIt's good practice to clear your environment. Over time your Global Environmental will fill up with many objects, and this can result in unexpected errors or objects being overridden with unexpected values. Also it's difficult to read / reference your environment when it's cluttered!\n:::\n\n## Save Workspace Image to .RData?\n\n![](images/r_programming_introduction/save-workspace.png){width=\"50%\"}\n\n**DON'T SAVE**\n\nWhen ever you close or switch projects you will be promped with the question: Do you want to save your workspace image to /\"current-project\"/ .RData?\n\nRStudio by default wants to save the state of your environment (the objects you have in your environment pane) into the RData file so that when you open the project again you have the same environment. However, as we discussed above, it is good practice to constantly clear and clean your environment. It is generally **NOT** a good practice to rely on the state of your environment for your script to run and work. If you are coding reproducibly, your code should be able to reproduce the state of your environment (all the necessary objects) every time you run it. It is much better to rely on your code recreating the environment than saving the workspace status.\n\nTo make sure you're always working reproducibly, change the Global Options configuration for the default to be NEVER SAVE MY WORKSPACE. Go to Tools > Global Options. Under the General menu, select Never next to \"Save workspace to .RData on exit\" (and uncheck \"Restore .RData into workspace at startup\"). This way you won't get asked every time you close a project, instead RStudio knows not to save.\n\n![](images/r_programming_introduction/save-workspace-global-options.png)\n\n",
