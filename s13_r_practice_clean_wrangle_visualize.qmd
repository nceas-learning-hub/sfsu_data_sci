## About the data {.unnumbered}

These exercises will be using data on abundance, size, and trap counts (fishing pressure) of California spiny lobster (*Panulirus interruptus*) and were collected along the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara Channel by Santa Barbara Coastal LTER researchers [CITATION].

Your task: Collaborate on an analysis and create a report to publish using GitHub Pages.

::: {.callout-tip}
### Setup

1.  Create a new repository with a partner
    a.  Determine who is the Owner and who is the Collaborator
    b.  The Owner creates a repository on GitHub titled with both your names (i.e. If Casey and Camila were partners, and Casey is the Owner, she would create a repo called `casey-camila`)
        i.  When creating the repository, add a brief description (i.e. R Practice Session: Collaborating on, Wrangling & Visualizing Data), keep the repo Public, and Initialize the repo with a `README` file and an R `.gitignore` template.
    c.  The Owner adds the Collaborator to the repo
    d.  Both the Collaborator and the Owner clone the repo into their RStudio
    <!-- e.  Both the Collaborator and the Owner run ```git config pull.rebase false``` in the Terminal to set the `Git` default strategy for `Pull`ing -->

**Step 2 and Step 3 are meant <u>to be completed at the same time</u>. 
- Collaborator completes Step 2
- Owner completes Step 3

2.  **Collaborator** creates new files for exercise
    a. The Collaborator creates the following directory (folder):
        i. `analysis` 
    b. After creating the directories, create the following Quarto Documents and store them in the listed folders:
        i.  Title it: "Owner Analysis", save it as: `owner-analysis.qmd`, and store in `analysis` folder
        ii. Title it: "Collaborator Analysis", save it as: `collaborator-analysis.qmd`, and store in `analysis` folder
        iii. Title it: "Lobster Report" and save it as: `lobster-report.qmd` and store in `analysis` folder
    b.  After creating the files, the Collaborator will `stage (add)`, `commit`, write a commit message, `pull`, and `push` the files to the remote repository (on GitHub)
    c.  The Owner `pull`s the changes and Quarto Documents into their local repository (their workspace)

3.  **Owner** downloads data from the EDI Data Portal [SBC LTER: Reef: Abundance, size and fishing effort for California Spiny Lobster (Panulirus interruptus), ongoing since 2012](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-sbc.77.8).
    a.  Create two new directories one called `data` and one called `figs`
        i. *Note: Git does not track empty directories, so you won't see `figs` when you push to GitHub*
    b.  Download the following data and upload them to the `data` folder:
        i.  Time-series of lobster abundance and size
        ii. Time-series of lobster trap buoy counts
    c.  After creating the `data` folder and adding the data, the Owner will `stage (add)`, `commit`, write a commit message,`pull`, and `push` the files to the remote repository (on GitHub)
    d.  The Collaborator `pull`s the changes and data into their local repository (their workspace)
:::

## Explore, clean and wrangle data

For this portion of the exercise, the 
- <u>Owner</u> will be working with the **lobster abundance and size data**
- <u>Collaborator</u> will be working with the **lobster trap buoy counts data**

Questions 1-3 you will be working independently since you're working with different data frames, but you're welcome to check in with each other.

#### Convert missing values using `mutate()` and `na_if()`

::: {.callout-exercise}
### Question 1

The variable `SIZE_MM` uses -99999 as the code for missing values (see metadata or use `unique()`). This has the potential to cause conflicts with our analyses, so let's convert -99999 to an `NA` value. Do this using `mutate()` and `na_if()`. Look up the help page to see how to use `na_if()`. Check your output data using `unique()`.

## Create visually appealing and informative data visualization

::: panel-tabset

### Owner

::: callout-tip
### Setup

1. Stay in the Quarto Document `owner-analysis.qmd` and create a new section with a level 2 header and title it "Exercise: Data Visualization"

**Structure of the data visualization exercises:** 

-  In this section, you will first have you create the necessary subsets to create the data visualizations, as well as the basic code to create a visualization. 
- The next step is to return to the data visualization code you've written and add styling code to it. For this exercise, only add styling code to the visualization you want to include in the `lobster-report.qmd` (start with just one plot and if there's time add styling code to another plot).

- Lastly, save the final visualizations to the `figs` folder before collaborating on the `lobster-report.qmd`.

### Question 5
Create a multi-panel plot of lobster carapace length (`SIZE_MM`) using `ggplot()`, `geom_histogram()`, and `facet_wrap()`. Use the variable `SITE` in `facet_wrap()`. Use the object `lobster_abundance`.

::: {.callout-exercise}
### Question 6

Create a line graph of the number of total lobsters observed (y-axis) by year (x-axis) in the study, grouped by `SITE`.

:::: {.callout-answer}

First, you'll need to create a new dataset subset called `lobsters_summarize`:

- Group the data by `SITE` AND `YEAR`
- Calculate the total number of lobsters observed using `count()`

```r
lobsters_summarize <- lobster_abundance %>% 
  group_by(SITE, YEAR) %>% 
  summarize(COUNT = n())
```

Next, create a line graph using `ggplot()` and `geom_line()`. Use `geom_point()` to make the data points more distinct, but ultimately up to you if you want to use it or not. We also want `SITE` information on this graph, do this by specifying the variable in the `color` argument. Where should the `color` argument go? Inside or outside of `aes()`? Why or why not?

```r
# line plot
ggplot(data = lobsters_summarize, aes(x = YEAR, y = COUNT)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = SITE)) 

# line and point plot
ggplot(data = lobsters_summarize, aes(x = YEAR, y = COUNT)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = SITE)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = SITE)) 
```

::: {.callout-exercise}
### Question 7
Create a bar graph that shows the amount of small and large sized carapace lobsters at each `SITE` from 2019-2021. **Note:** The small and large metrics are completely made up and are not based on any known facts.

:::: {.callout-answer}

First, you'll need to create a new dataset subset called `lobster_size_lrg`:

- `filter()` for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021
- Add a new column called `SIZE_BIN` that contains the values "small" or "large".  A "small" carapace size is <= 70 mm, and a "large" carapace size is greater than 70 mm. Use `mutate()` and `if_else()`. Check your output
- Calculate the number of "small" and "large" sized lobsters using `group()` and `summarize()`. Check your output
- Remove the `NA` values from the subsetted data. Hint: check out `drop_na()`. Check your output

```r
lobster_size_lrg <- lobster_abundance %>%
    filter(YEAR %in% c(2019, 2020, 2021)) %>%
    mutate(SIZE_BIN = if_else(SIZE_MM <= 70, true = "small", false = "large")) %>%
    group_by(SITE, SIZE_BIN) %>%
    summarize(COUNT = n()) %>%
    drop_na()
```

Next, create a bar graph using `ggplot()` and `geom_bar()`. Note that `geom_bar()` automatically creates a stacked bar chart. Try using the argument `position = "dodge"` to make the bars side by side. Pick which bar position you like best.

```r
# bar plot
ggplot(data = lobster_size_lrg, aes(x = SITE, y = COUNT, fill = SIZE_BIN)) +
    geom_col()

# dodged bar plot
ggplot(data = lobster_size_lrg, aes(x = SITE, y = COUNT, fill = SIZE_BIN)) +
    geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

::: {.callout-exercise}
### Question 8

1. Go back to your visualization code and add some styling code (aka make your plots pretty!). Again, start with one plot and if there's time add styling code to additional plots. Here's a list of functions to help you get started (this is not an exhaustive list!) or revisit the [data visualization lesson](https://learning.nceas.ucsb.edu/2023-04-coreR/session_12.html):

- `labs()`: modifying axis, legend and plot labels
- `theme_()`: add a complete theme to your plot (i.e. `theme_light()`)
- `theme()`: use to customize non-data components of a plot. We've listed out some parameters here, but run `?theme` to see the full list (there's a lot of customization you can do!)
    - `axis.title.y`
    - `panel.background`
    - `plot.background`
    - `panel.grid.major.*`
    - `text`
- `scale_*_date()`: use with dates and update breaks, limits, and labels
- `scale_*_continuous()`: use with continuous variables and update breaks, limits, and labels
- `scale_*_discrete()`: use with discrete variables and update breaks, limits, and labels
- `scales` package: use this within the above scale functions and you can do things like add percents to axes labels
- `geom_()` within a geom function you can modify:
    - `fill`: updates fill colors (e.g. column, density, violin, & boxplot interior fill color)
    - `color`: updates point & border line colors (generally)
    - `shape`: update point style
    - `alpha`: update transparency (0 = transparent, 1 = opaque)
    - `size`: point size or line width
    - `linetype`: update the line type (e.g. "dotted", "dashed", "dotdash", etc.)
    
2. Once you're happy with how your plot looks, assign it to an object, and save it to the `figs` directory using `ggsave()`

### Question 6

Create a line graph of the number of total lobster commercial traps observed (y-axis) by year (x-axis) in the study, grouped by `SITE`.

:::: {.callout-answer}

First, you'll need to create a new dataset subset called `lobsters_traps_summarize`:

- Group the data by `SITE` AND `YEAR`
- Calculate the total number of lobster commercial traps observed using `sum()`. Look up `sum()` if you need to. Call the new column `TOTAL_TRAPS`. Don't forget about `NAs` here!

```r
lobsters_traps_summarize <- lobster_traps %>% 
  group_by(SITE, YEAR) %>% 
  summarize(TOTAL_TRAPS = sum(TRAPS, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Next, create a line graph using `ggplot()` and `geom_line()`. Use `geom_point()` to make the data points more distinct, but ultimately up to you if you want to use it or not.

**Note:** The high and low fishing pressure metrics are completely made up and are not based on any known facts.

:::: {.callout-answer}

First, you'll need to create a new dataset subset called `lobster_traps_fishing_pressure`:

- `filter()` for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021
- Add a new column called `FISHING_PRESSURE` that contains the values "high" or "low". A "high" fishing pressure has exactly or more than 8 traps, and a "low" fishing pressure has less than 8 traps. Use `mutate()` and `if_else()`. Check your output
- Calculate the number of "high" and "low" observations using `group()` and `summarize()`. Check your output 
- Remove the `NA` values from the subsetted data. Hint: check out `drop_na()`. Check your output

```r
lobster_traps_fishing_pressure <- lobster_traps %>% 
    filter(YEAR %in% c(2019, 2020, 2021)) %>%
    mutate(FISHING_PRESSURE = if_else(TRAPS >= 8, true = "high", false = "low")) %>%

## Collaborate on a report and publish using GitHub pages

The final step! Time to work together again. Collaborate with your partner in `lobster-report.qmd` to create a report to publish to GitHub pages.

::: {.callout-note}
### Code Review
As you're working on the `lobster-report.qmd` you will be conducting [two types of code reviews](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Software_Engineering/Quality/Code_Review#:~:text=Code%20review%20practices%20fall%20into,review%20and%20lightweight%20code%20review): (1) pair programming and (2) lightweight code review.

- **Pair programming** is where two people develop code together at the same workstation. One person is the "driver" and one person is the "navigator". The driver writes the code while the navigator observes the code being typed, points out any immediate quick fixes, and will also Google / troubleshoot if errors occur. Both the Owner and the Collaborator should experience both roles, so switch halfway through or at a meaningful stopping point.

- A **lightweight code review** is brief and you will be giving feedback on code readability and code logic as you're adding Owner and Collaborator code from their respective `analysis.qmd`s to the `lobster-report.qmd`. Think of it as a walk through of your the code for the data visualizations you plan to include in the report (this includes the code you wrote to create the subset for the plot and the code to create the plot) and give quick feedback.

-   brief summary of the abstract (i.e. 1-2 sentences) from the [EDI Portal](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-sbc.77.8)
-   Owner analysis and visualizations (you choose which plots you want to include)
    - Try adding alternative text to your plots (See [Quarto Documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#alt-text))
    - Plots can be added either with the data visualization code or with Markdown syntax (calling a saved image) - it's up to you if you want to include the code or not. 
-   Collaborator analysis and visualizations (you choose which plots you want to include)
    - Try adding alternative text to your plots (See [Quarto Documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#alt-text))
    - plots can be added either with the data visualization code or with Markdown syntax (calling a saved image) - it's up to you if you want to include the code or not. 

Finally, publish on GitHub pages (from Owner's repository). Refer back to [Chapter 12](https://learning.nceas.ucsb.edu/2024-10-coreR/session_12.html) for steps on how to publish using GitHub pages.


## Bonus: Add marine protected area (MPA) designation to the data

The sites `IVEE` and `NAPL` are marine protected areas (MPAs). Add this designation to your data set using a new function called `case_when()`. Then create some new plots using this new variable. Does it change how you think about the data? What new plots or analysis can you do with this new variable?

### Lobster Abundance & Size Data

Use the object `lobster_abundance` and add a new column called `DESIGNATION` that contains "MPA" if the site is `IVEE` or `NAPL`, and "not MPA" for all other values.

```r
lobster_mpa <- lobster_abundance %>% 
    mutate(DESIGNATION = case_when(
    SITE %in% c("IVEE", "NAPL") ~ "MPA",
    SITE %in% c("AQUE", "CARP", "MOHK") ~ "not MPA"
  ))
    
```


### Lobster Trap Buoy Counts Data

Use the object `lobster_traps` and add a new column called `DESIGNATION` that contains "MPA" if the site is `IVEE` or `NAPL`, and "not MPA" for all other values.

```r
lobster_traps_mpa <- lobster_traps %>%
    mutate(DESIGNATION = case_when(
    SITE %in% c("IVEE", "NAPL") ~ "MPA",
    SITE %in% c("AQUE", "CARP", "MOHK") ~ "not MPA"
  ))
```
